## Just bit brush up and learning bit of TDD

## Installation 
Multiple ways of installing project since there isn't really much different from default package other than having a docker-compose. For this project i have used laravel sail but you can use any host. 

## Current status
pretty bare bones at the moment haven't really started.

## Aims 
1.Essentially get couple quotes off kanye quote website and randomize it. 
2. Use TDD
3. make sure there is form of token 

## Considerations
### Service
1. The use of static method batch on guzzle will have some limitations as it uses memory so as long as number of calls are not huge it should not be a problem.

## Testing
Using PHP Unit depending on how you have set up the project u can just use default php unit command line or in my case just sail alternate version.
