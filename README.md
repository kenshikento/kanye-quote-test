## Just bit brush up and learning bit of TDD

## Installation 
Multiple ways of installing project since there isn't really much different from default package other than having a docker-compose. For this project i have used laravel sail but you can use any host.

## Aims 
1.Essentially get couple quotes off kanye quote website and randomize it. 
2. Use TDD
3. make sure there is form of token
